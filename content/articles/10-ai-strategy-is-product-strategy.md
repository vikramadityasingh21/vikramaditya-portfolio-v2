# AI Strategy Is Product Strategy

## Why Value Creation, Not Model Sophistication, Determines AI Success

---

## Abstract

**Context:** Organizations across sectors have invested billions in artificial intelligence, establishing AI centers of excellence, deploying foundation models, and launching extensive pilot programs. Adoption rates now exceed 70% globally, with generative AI usage doubling year-over-year since 2023.

**Problem:** Despite this investment intensity, the overwhelming majority of AI initiatives fail to deliver sustained business value. Recent research from MIT reveals that only 5% of enterprise AI pilots achieve measurable P&L impact. Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be cancelled by 2027. The standard explanations—data quality, talent gaps, infrastructure limitations—are technically accurate but strategically incomplete. They describe symptoms rather than causes.

**Here we argue:** That AI failures are not primarily technical failures—they are *product failures*. Organizations systematically treat AI as a technology initiative to be deployed rather than as a product capability to be discovered, validated, and continuously evolved within user workflows, operating models, and value streams. The consequence is predictable: technical achievements without adoption, model accuracy without outcome impact, and pilot success without scaled value.

**Conclusion:** AI strategy must be reframed, governed, and executed as product strategy. Without the disciplined application of product thinking—clear user value definition, single-threaded outcome ownership, continuous discovery, and iterative learning—AI systems will scale complexity rather than impact. The competitive advantage belongs not to organizations with the most sophisticated models but to those that embed AI into products users actually adopt.

## 1. Introduction: The Paradox of AI Progress

The enterprise AI landscape presents a striking paradox. By every conventional measure, AI adoption has succeeded. Over the past six years, McKinsey's research has consistently tracked AI adoption growth, with 88% of organizations now using AI regularly in at least one function. Generative AI adoption has soared, with 65% of organizations reporting regular use—nearly double the percentage from just ten months prior. Investment continues at unprecedented scale, with enterprises allocating substantial portions of their digital budgets to AI initiatives.

Yet measured by the only metric that ultimately matters—sustained business impact—the picture inverts dramatically. MIT's State of AI in Business 2025 report reveals that only about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. IDC found that 88% of observed AI POCs don't make the cut to widescale deployment—for every 33 AI POCs a company launched, only four graduated to production.

This is not a technology failure. The models work. The platforms are capable. The infrastructure exists. As Gartner's Anushree Verma observed, "Most agentic AI projects right now are early stage experiments or proof of concepts that are mostly driven by hype and are often misapplied." The failure lies not in AI capability but in organizational application—specifically, in the absence of product thinking at the strategic level.

### 1.1 The Technology-First Trap

When organizations approach AI, they typically begin with technology questions: What models should we deploy? What data do we possess? What platforms should we acquire? This orientation produces predictable outcomes: model-centric roadmaps, platform-heavy investments, and abstract use cases disconnected from actual delivery. Technical milestones are achieved while user adoption stagnates.

The pattern repeats because it reflects how organizations have historically adopted enterprise technology—as infrastructure to be installed rather than capability to be discovered. But AI behaves differently. Its outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic. Its performance drifts over time. Its value depends entirely on context-specific integration with human decision-making and workflow. These properties make product thinking not merely beneficial but essential.

---

## 2. AI Systems Behave Like Products, Not Tools

The fundamental category error in most AI strategies is treating AI as a tool when it behaves as a product. Tools are discrete, static, and task-specific. Products are continuous, evolving, and user-embedded. The distinction has profound implications for strategy.

### 2.1 Properties That Demand Product Thinking

AI systems exhibit four properties that make traditional tool-deployment approaches inadequate:

**Probabilistic behavior.** Unlike deterministic software, AI outputs vary. The same input may produce different outputs, and edge cases emerge continuously in production. This requires ongoing quality management through user feedback loops—a core product discipline.

**Performance drift.** AI models degrade over time as the data distribution shifts. Nearly half of organizations cited searchability of data (48%) and reusability of data (47%) as challenges to their AI automation strategy. Models require continuous monitoring and retraining—not one-time deployment and maintenance.

**Context sensitivity.** AI effectiveness depends heavily on integration context. A model that performs well in isolation may fail when embedded in actual workflows with real constraints, edge cases, and human factors. Value emerges only through iterative refinement in production context.

**Trust dynamics.** User adoption of AI depends on trust calibration—neither over-reliance nor excessive skepticism produces good outcomes. Building appropriate trust requires the same careful attention to user experience that defines successful product development.

These properties collectively mean that AI systems never "finish." They require continuous discovery, measurement, and improvement—the defining characteristics of product management.

### 2.2 The Implications Are Structural

If AI systems are products, then AI strategy requires product disciplines: clear outcome ownership, continuous user research, hypothesis-driven development, rapid experimentation, and iterative refinement. Organizations that apply project management to product problems—with fixed scope, milestone-driven governance, and success defined by "completion"—will fail regardless of their technical sophistication.

This explains a pattern visible in industry research: High performers are 3.6 times more likely than others to aim for transformational, enterprise-level change with AI rather than incremental tweaks. They are also far more willing to redesign workflows: 55% say they fundamentally reworked processes when deploying AI—almost three times the rate of other firms. The differentiator is not model capability but organizational approach.

## 3. The Core Failure Mode: Ownership Without Outcomes

A pattern emerges consistently across failed AI initiatives: ownership is distributed while outcomes are owned by no one.

| AI Component | Typical Owner |
|--------------|---------------|
| Model accuracy | Data Science |
| Infrastructure | Platform Engineering |
| Compliance | Risk / Legal |
| Integration | IT |
| Business value | *Unclear* |

When accountability fragments this way, each function optimizes locally while value dissipates globally. Data science teams achieve impressive benchmark scores on models that users don't adopt. Platform teams build capable infrastructure that hosts unused applications. Risk teams implement governance that prevents deployment entirely. And no single leader faces the question: *Did this AI investment actually create value?*

As Melissa Perri argues in *Escaping the Build Trap*, organizations that optimize for delivery without owning outcomes systematically fail to create value¹. This principle applies with particular force to AI, where the gap between technical achievement and business impact is especially wide.

### 3.1 The Ownership Gap Is Measurable

McKinsey's research shows that only 20% of companies measure AI success with business metrics. The remaining 80% track proxy measures—model accuracy, deployment velocity, platform utilization—that may or may not correlate with actual value creation. When no one owns outcomes, no one measures outcomes. When no one measures outcomes, no one achieves them.

The solution is structural: designate single-threaded owners for AI value—leaders accountable not for building and deploying but for whether deployed AI actually improves business results. This is the defining characteristic of product leadership, applied to AI.

## 4. AI Strategy as Product Strategy: The Four Disciplines

We define AI Product Strategy as:

> *The deliberate design of AI-enabled capabilities that deliver measurable user and organizational outcomes through continuous discovery, delivery, and learning.*

This definition implies four disciplines that distinguish successful AI strategies from failed ones.

### 4.1 Clear User and Decision Context

AI must support a specific user making a specific decision in a specific context. Abstract "use cases"—improve customer service, enhance productivity, accelerate operations—are insufficient. Successful AI products answer precise questions:

- Who is the user? (Not "customers" but which customer segment in which situation)
- What decision or task is being improved? (Not "customer service" but which service interaction)
- What does success look like from the user's perspective?
- What workflow integration is required?

Deloitte's Tech Trends 2026 report identifies this as the central challenge: "The challenge isn't technology, it's that enterprises are trying to automate existing processes designed for humans rather than redesigning them for AI-first operations." AI succeeds when it's designed for specific contexts, not when it's deployed as generic capability.

### 4.2 Outcome-Driven Metrics

AI success must be measured by business outcomes, not technical metrics:

| What to Measure | What to Avoid |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Decision quality improvement | Model accuracy in isolation |
| Cycle time reduction | Number of deployments |
| Error rate decrease | Platform utilization |
| User adoption and retention | Technical milestone completion |
| Revenue or cost impact | POC demonstrations |

McKinsey's 2025 survey finds workflow redesign is the single biggest driver of EBIT impact from gen-AI. Organizations that measure workflow-level outcomes rather than model-level metrics systematically outperform those that don't.

### 4.3 Continuous Discovery

Because AI behavior evolves and context determines value, discovery cannot be a phase—it must be a continuous practice. Teresa Torres, in *Continuous Discovery Habits*, articulates this principle: product teams must "infuse their daily product decisions with customer input"². For AI products, this means:

- Weekly touchpoints with users to understand evolving needs and pain points
- Systematic collection of production feedback on AI output quality
- Rapid hypothesis testing on potential improvements
- Iterative refinement based on real-world evidence

The research validates this approach. MIT found that "the core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time." Discovery-driven approaches directly address this barrier.

### 4.4 Product-Led Governance

Traditional governance—stage gates, approval committees, compliance checkpoints—collapses under AI's adaptive nature. By the time reviews occur, systems have evolved. Documents describe yesterday's architecture. Approvals address risks that have already mutated.

AI governance must be product-led: enabling iteration while bounding risk, evolving with evidence rather than freezing at approval, and measuring outcomes rather than auditing artifacts. This requires:

- Risk guardrails rather than approval gates
- Continuous monitoring rather than periodic review
- Outcome accountability rather than compliance certification
- Escalation triggers based on signals rather than schedules

Organizations that apply static governance to adaptive systems create either paralysis (nothing deploys) or theater (governance is circumvented). Neither produces safe, effective AI at scale.

## 5. Evidence: Why Pilots Fail to Scale

The research on AI pilot failure is extensive and consistent. The causes cluster around missing product disciplines, not missing technology.

### 5.1 The Scale of Pilot Failure

In 2025, the average enterprise scrapped 46% of AI pilots before they ever reached production. Nearly two-thirds of companies admit they remain stuck in AI proof-of-concepts unable to transition to full operation.

A recent MIT study found 95% of enterprise gen-AI pilots fail to deliver measurable P&L impact—mostly due to integration, data, and governance gaps, not model capability.

Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value, or inadequate risk controls.

### 5.2 The Pattern Behind the Failures

Pilots fail not because they don't work technically but because they were never designed as products:

**The user journey is incomplete.** Pilots demonstrate capability without integration into actual workflows. Users must adapt their processes to use the AI, creating friction that prevents adoption.

**The value exchange is unclear.** Users don't understand what the AI offers them or why they should change behavior to use it. Value is assumed rather than validated.

**Ownership ends at delivery.** Once the pilot is "complete," no one owns its evolution. Without continuous improvement, initial limitations become permanent barriers.

**Success metrics are internal.** Pilots succeed by technical measures visible to builders but fail by adoption measures visible to users.

MIT's research found that "purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often." The success of vendor solutions reflects their product maturity—they've iterated based on real customer feedback across many deployments.

## 6. The Operating Model Shift

McKinsey's analysis reveals the operating model differentiator: "Plug-in thinking (add a tool to an old process) versus rewiring thinking (use AI as a reason to redesign the process itself). That's the real cut line."

### 6.1 What High Performers Do Differently

High performers are three times more likely than their peers to strongly agree that senior leaders at their organizations demonstrate ownership of and commitment to their AI initiatives. These respondents are also much more likely than others to say that senior leaders are actively engaged in driving AI adoption, including role modeling the use of AI.

High performers are also more likely to employ a range of practices to realize value from AI use. For example, high performers are more likely than others to say their organizations have defined processes to determine how and when model outputs need human validation to ensure accuracy.

The pattern is clear: high performers apply product discipline to AI. They assign ownership, measure outcomes, integrate deeply, and iterate continuously.

### 6.2 The Rewired Organization

McKinsey's Rewired framework identifies six dimensions essential to AI value: strategy, talent, operating model, technology, data, and adoption at scale³. Notably, technology is only one of six—and often not the binding constraint. Having an agile product delivery organization, or an enterprise-wide agile organization with well-defined delivery processes, is strongly correlated with achieving value.

This validates the core thesis: AI success is an organizational capability, not a technical one. The capability is product management applied to AI.

## 7. Implications for Leaders

### 7.1 For Product Leaders

**Own AI outcomes, not just AI features.** Product leaders should be accountable for whether AI-enabled capabilities create value, not just whether they ship. This requires expanding the definition of the product to include AI components as first-class elements requiring discovery, measurement, and iteration.

**Treat models as components, not deliverables.** AI models are means to ends, not ends themselves. The product is the user value delivered; the model is one component enabling that value. This framing prevents the technology-first trap.

**Invest in discovery as much as delivery.** Teresa Torres advocates for continuous discovery as "a weekly rhythm" including "starting with a clear, measurable outcome, running interviews every week, mapping the insights you collect into your opportunity space, picking one opportunity to focus on, brainstorming multiple possible solutions, and running small assumption tests before committing." AI products require this discipline with particular intensity.

### 7.2 For Executives

**Assign single-threaded ownership for AI value.** The fragmented ownership model—data science owns models, IT owns infrastructure, business owns "strategy"—guarantees failure. Designate leaders accountable for end-to-end value creation.

**Measure business impact, not deployment count.** Over 80% of respondents say their organizations are not seeing a tangible impact on enterprise-level EBIT from their use of gen AI. If you're not measuring impact, you won't achieve it.

**Fund learning cycles, not just builds.** AI requires continuous investment in discovery and iteration, not one-time funding for development. Budget for the full product lifecycle.

### 7.3 For Government and Regulated Sectors

**Design AI systems that evolve safely.** Regulatory requirements for explainability, auditability, and safety don't preclude iteration—they require thoughtful governance that enables controlled evolution.

**Preserve human judgment where policy intent matters.** AI should augment human decision-making in sensitive contexts, not replace it entirely. The design challenge is appropriate human-in-the-loop integration.

**Avoid freezing interpretation into code prematurely.** Policy interpretation should remain contestable even when encoded in AI systems. Design for amendment and appeal.

## 8. Conclusion: AI Succeeds Where Product Thinking Prevails

AI does not fail because models are weak, data is imperfect, or infrastructure is immature. RAND Corporation's 2024 research delivers a verdict that should shake every C-suite: 84% of AI implementation failures are leadership-driven, not technical.

AI fails because:
- No one owns the outcome
- Value is assumed, not validated
- Delivery ends too early
- Success is measured by technical metrics, not user impact

These are product failures, requiring product solutions.

The organizations that succeed with AI will not be those with the most sophisticated models or the largest data sets. They will be organizations that apply disciplined product thinking to AI: clear user value, single-threaded ownership, continuous discovery, and outcome-driven governance.

**AI strategy is product strategy.** Without product discipline, AI simply automates confusion at scale. With it, AI becomes what it promises to be: a transformative capability that creates lasting competitive advantage.

## Author's Notes: Lessons from the AI Graveyard

*The thesis of this article crystallized during a portfolio review of AI initiatives at a large enterprise. The organization had launched over forty AI pilots across two years. They had built sophisticated capabilities, hired talented teams, and invested substantially in infrastructure.*

*By every input metric, they were succeeding: models deployed, platforms built, use cases identified. Yet when we examined outcomes—actual business impact—fewer than a handful had moved to production, and only two had measurable P&L effect.*

*The technical teams were talented. The models performed well in benchmarks. The infrastructure was capable. What was missing was elementary: no one owned outcomes. Each pilot had multiple stakeholders but no single accountable leader. Each had technical success criteria but no business impact measures. Each had a delivery timeline but no discovery cadence.*

*When I asked who was responsible for whether these pilots created value, the answer was telling: "Well, the business case is owned by the business, the model is owned by data science, the integration is owned by IT..." The sentence could continue indefinitely because the actual answer was "no one."*

*This pattern—distributed ownership, technical metrics, delivery-focused governance—defines the AI strategies that fail. And it fails for the same reason it fails in traditional software: building without owning outcomes is activity without accountability.*

*The organizations I've seen succeed treat AI differently from the start. They assign product owners with outcome accountability. They measure what matters to users and the business. They iterate based on production evidence. They invest in discovery continuously, not just during planning.*

*For leaders reading this, my advice is concrete: before your next AI initiative, answer one question clearly—who will be accountable if this doesn't create business value, and how will they be measured? If you can't answer that question, you're not ready to proceed.*

*AI is not special in requiring product discipline. It's just the latest domain where we're learning the lesson again. The discipline works because users and outcomes always matter more than technology and features. That's true for AI as it was for mobile, as it was for web, as it was for client-server. The lesson repeats because organizations keep forgetting it.*

*Don't forget it again.*
